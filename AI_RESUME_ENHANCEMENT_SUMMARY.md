## 💡 **Interview Talking Points**

### **Question: "Do you have AI experience?"**

**Your Answer:**
> "Yes, I recently integrated OpenAI's GPT-4o and Vision APIs into a production education application. I implemented two key AI features:
> 
> 1. **GPT-4o Vision for image recognition** - automated document classification and processing, which eliminated manual data entry errors
> 
> 2. **GPT-3.5-turbo for intelligent response generation** - provided automated, context-aware responses to application submissions
> 
> The AI integration was part of a larger full-stack application that reduced processing time by 75% and generated $40K in annual savings. I handled everything from prompt engineering to production deployment, including error handling, rate limiting, and fallback strategies when the API was unavailable.
> 
> I'm comfortable with the OpenAI API, prompt engineering, and building production-grade AI features that deliver real business value."

**Why This Answer Works:**
- Specific technologies (not vague "AI experience")
- Production implementation (not tutorials)
- Business impact (not just technical details)
- Shows depth (prompt engineering, error handling, production concerns)

---

### **Question: "What's your experience with GPT-4?"**

**Your Answer:**
> "I've implemented both GPT-4o (the optimized version) and GPT-4o Vision in production. GPT-4o Vision was particularly powerful for our use case - it could analyze uploaded documents and images, extract relevant information, and classify them automatically.
> 
> Some key learnings:
> - Prompt engineering is critical - I iterated through 10+ prompt variations to optimize accuracy
> - Cost management matters - GPT-4o is more expensive than GPT-3.5, so I used 3.5-turbo for simpler tasks
> - Error handling is essential - I built fallback logic for rate limits and API failures
> - Context window management - learned to optimize token usage for cost efficiency
> 
> I'm excited about the potential of GPT-4o and am actively following the latest developments from OpenAI."

**Why This Answer Works:**
- Shows technical depth
- Demonstrates cost awareness (important for businesses)
- Mentions production concerns (reliability, error handling)
- Shows you're staying current
